Welcome to Sandworm—the foundation of AuthZed's design.

Sandworm is AuthZed's unified design system, quietly powering everything we build. Like the sandworms of Arrakis, it's always there—just beneath the surface—providing the structure and resources we need to create cohesive, scalable, and user-friendly experiences.

Whether you're designing something new or enhancing an existing feature, Sandworm ensures consistency and simplicity every step of the way. It's a living, evolving system, adapting to meet our needs while staying true to the core of what makes AuthZed, AuthZed.

Explore Sandworm, and build with confidence knowing it's always there to support you.
