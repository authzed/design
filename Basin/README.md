Welcome to Basin—a collection of design tools born from real-world challenges.

Basin serves as a central repository for AuthZed's design tools and resources. Like a hidden desert basin that collects precious water, Basin collects and preserves valuable design solutions that have emerged from our own challenges. These tools have been refined, documented, and made accessible to support thoughtful, scalable, and consistent design across projects.

Whether you're starting a new project or enhancing an existing one, Basin provides the tools and resources you need to build with confidence. It's a growing collection, continuously enriched with new solutions as we discover and develop them.

Explore Basin, and leverage these tools to accelerate your design process.
